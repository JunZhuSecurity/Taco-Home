# Taco-Home
This Chrome extension makes searching for a home easier by including important home information that Zillow leaves out. Each time a home detail is opened on Zillow, Taco Home automatically searches for the nearest Taco Bell and inserts the distance and drive time into the page.

Taco Home uses the Google Maps API to find the coordinates of the address listed on Zillow then searches for the coordinates of the nearest Taco Bell.
